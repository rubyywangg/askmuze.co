to deploy your react application (manual version)

- go into your finished files
- usually you should be in the react-app folder of your finished project
- in terminal run "npm install"
- in terminal run "npm run build"
- now using Netlify or any other react deployment website, drag and drop your folder with the optimized code for production (usually the folder called build)
- in netlify, if you click "Open production deploy" it should open ur website!!!
